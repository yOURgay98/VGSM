# ESS Desktop (Tauri Scaffold)

This directory contains a scaffold for a Tauri desktop wrapper around the ESS web app.

- It is **not** a game overlay and does not hook other processes.
- It stores **no** passwords.
- It reuses the existing web auth session via the webview cookie store.

See `docs/desktop.md` for setup and build instructions.
